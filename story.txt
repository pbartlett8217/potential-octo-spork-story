There once was a man named Julius Brutus who lived in ancient Rome. He was a soldier and had to fight 
many great battles. He has a family that he hopes he can return to each time. He is afraid that one day
his family might have to take care of themselves alone one day, but he takes pride in being apart
of the greatest empires that ever existed.
One particularly stormy day, he was called into battle. He and his fellow soldiers could barely see where they were going, all they knew was that they had to go north. So through the rain they marched. They were told to keep marching until they reached the city.
