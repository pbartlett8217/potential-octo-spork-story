There once was a man named Julius Brutus who lived in ancient Rome. He was a soldier and had to fight 
many great battles. He has a family that he hopes he can return to each time. He is afraid that one day
his family might have to take care of themselves alone one day, but he takes pride in being apart
of the greatest empires that ever existed.
